        <p>The code you write will look very different from almost any other language depending on which programming language you know.


Some programming languages read just like English and make it easy for beginners to understand.

But others have a much more cryptic feeling to them, meaning that if you have never learned coding before, they are more difficult to understand and master.

The "easier" programming languages are called high-level programming languages, because they are not at all similar to the low-level binary code.

Similarly, the more cryptic languages are called low-level programming languages, because they are closer to a computer's binary code.</p>
        <p>Many programming languages are becoming more common and all-purpose nowadays, but these languages have their specialities and each language has its own advantages and disadvantages. Programming languages may typically be divided into a few types but these languages allow many styles of programming.A number of programming languages are introduced each year, but few languages are becoming very common which may be used in their career by a professional programmer. there are a number of programming languages are implemented, but few languages are becoming very popular which may used by a professional programmer in their career.</p>
