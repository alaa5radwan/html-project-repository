            <p>What you should learn most about programming languages is this:</p>
            

<p>Program languages allow us to communicate with computers through computer code ith out any ambiguity.</p>

<p>Each programming language is just a way of telling a computer what it should be doing. The computer understands this language, and knows how to interpret it.</p>
            <p>This is a lot like learning any other language when you learn a particular programming language. You need to understand how the language works and follow some set of rules, much like spoken language grammar.</p>

<p>Each language is different ,syou are going to use it for various types of projects and serve the same purpose. They allow you to solve problems and build meaningful, useful programs and applications </p>
            <p>But we must know very well that computers only understand electronic signals, and they are only two types that you can give to the computer to understand what we want. They are either "on" or "off" and these signals are translated inside the computer to 1 and 0  .single computer program can therefore consist of millions of on / off signals. If you were just using 1's and 0's to read and write the programs, it would be extremely time-consuming. The whole process would also be extremely subject to mistakes.and thus comes the role of programming languages ​​to help us deal with  Code that is easy to write, read, and understand from simple binary codes that contain only 0 and 1.</p>
